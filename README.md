# Codebits Memory Game

A memory card game based in an API from [Codebits](https://codebits.eu).

The thing is that I don't like to limit things. So let us study the API, 
understand and clone it to enable some side loading, so that you can use the 
pics and games, that please you.

The challenge is a memory card game, without resource to any frameworks or 
libraries, so let us do that. Using plain HTML, CSS, and JS.
